OPERATIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS:
============================
1. Begin search immediately in Zone 1 (IMMEDIATE priority)
2. Deploy Coast Guard assets to highest probability areas
3. Use expanding square search pattern in primary zone
4. Expand to secondary zones if initial search unsuccessful
5. Monitor weather conditions for search planning
6. Coordinate with shore-based teams for shoreline search
