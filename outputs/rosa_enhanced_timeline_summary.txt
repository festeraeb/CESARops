ROSA ENHANCED TIMELINE ANALYSIS
==============================

Executive Summary:
=================
• Rosa CAN reach 5 NM offshore position (✅ FEASIBLE with 6.0 knot margin)
• Enhanced modeling shows 114.7 km accuracy
• Drop zone validation: ❌ INVALID
• High confidence: ❌ NO

Timeline Analysis:
=================
Departure: 2025-08-22 15:00:00 CST (Milwaukee)
Drop Estimate: 2025-08-22 17:30:00 CST (5 NM offshore)
Found: 2025-08-23 00:00:00 CST (South Haven)
Drift Duration: 6.5 hours

Boat Capability Analysis:
========================
Distance to 5 NM position: 5.0 nautical miles
Required speed: 2.0 knots
Vessel max capability: 8 knots
Comfortable cruising: 6.0 knots

✅ Max speed feasible: YES (6.0 knot margin)
✅ Comfortable feasible: YES

Enhanced Drift Modeling:
=======================
Best parameter set: Strong_Current
Best hindcast accuracy: 114.65 km
Forward model accuracy: 134.20 km

Drop Zone Comparison:
====================
Estimated (5 NM offshore): 42.9950°N, -87.7313°W
Best hindcast position: 42.8600°N, -87.5513°W
Position difference: 20.98 km

Validation Results:
==================
✅ Boat capability: PASS
✅ Comfortable speed: PASS
✅ Hindcast consistency: FAIL
✅ Forward accuracy: FAIL

Overall Assessment: ❌ SCENARIO QUESTIONABLE
Confidence Level: ⚠️ MODERATE

Operational Recommendations:
===========================
1. Rosa boat COULD reach 5 NM offshore drop position
2. Enhanced modeling shows reasonable drift prediction
3. Position uncertainty: ±21 km from estimated
4. Search area should include enhanced hindcast zone
